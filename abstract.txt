In this study, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on an insurance dataset to gain insights into the relationships between various attributes. The distribution of individual features was examined, missing values were identified, and outliers were detected to ensure the integrity of the dataset. Suitable imputation techniques were employed to replace missing values, and outliers were removed to mitigate potential skewness in subsequent analyses.

Furthermore, a correlation heatmap was constructed to visualize the relationships between different variables and to identify potential multicollinearity issues. The presence of multicollinearity, a common problem in regression analysis, was addressed to ensure the reliability of predictive models. By investigating correlations between variables, interdependencies were understood, and their impact on model performance was assessed. Finally, leveraging the insights gained from the EDA and preprocessing steps, machine learning algorithms were applied to predict the likelihood of insurance fraud. Classification models were trained and evaluated using various performance metrics to determine their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent claims. This comprehensive approach, from data exploration to model implementation, provides a robust framework for analyzing insurance datasets and developing predictive models to mitigate fraudulent activities.
